* Initialized the repository and planned the steps of how to build the project.
* Read project instructions and understood what was asked of me before beginning to write the code.
* Developing the file structure:
- main.py will open files that contains a B-Tree and thes files will be managed to create, insert, search, load, print, and extract.
* Future plans: Begin work on prompting users for files and read in those files in main.py.

* Create README.md that explains purposes and what the project does.
* Future plans: Begin work on prompting users for files and read in those files in main.py.

* Created main.py and organized the various sections off with comment blocks for organization.
- (Due to time constraints, everything has been done in one session)
* Created filemanager class which handles everything with memory allocation and reading + storing information into files.
* Created BTreeNode class which handles everything for each specific node inside of a BTree.
* Created BTree class that performs operations with the BTree after the file has been read.
* Created main function that acts as the wrapper of the entire program
* Future plans: Test the code.

* Created a input.csv file that is used for testing the load command.
* Testing each of the commands to determine if they work or not:
- (create, open, insert, search, load, print, extract, and quit.)
